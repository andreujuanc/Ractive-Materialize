## Note: active branch is 'dev' for now.


The goals for this projects come in 3 steps: 
 1. Provide components for [MaterializeCss](http://materializecss.com) as shorcuts and also simple UI Wrappers.
 2. Gradually port code from jquery to ractive.
 3. Diverge completely from MaterializeCss, and follow Google's Material Design from scratch, since porting code forever is not going to be good for anyome.
